                <p>Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS) undergraduate programs include certificates as well as A.A.S., A.S., B.S., B.S.N., and Pharm.D. degrees. Nearly 2,400 students enroll in our undergraduate programs each year. The programs range from certificates in dental assisting and vascular sonography to B.S. degrees in nursing and clinical laboratory science to the six-year doctor of pharmacy (Pharm.D.), the entry-level degree for pharmacists. Some programs require full-time attendance, while others offer part-time options.</p>
            <h2>School of Health Related Professions</h2>
                <p>Undergraduate education is a major focus of the <a href="http://shrp.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">School of Health Related Professions</a>. The school partners with many colleges and universities across the state to offer <a href="http://shrp.rutgers.edu/affiliates/index.htm" target="_blank">associate and bachelor&rsquo;s degrees and certificates</a> in a variety of fields. Joint degrees allow students to start their degrees in many locations across the state before coming to Rutgers for their professional coursework&mdash;a model that promotes cost effective, quality education.<br />
<br />
 In addition, the school&rsquo;s <a href="http://healthcareers.shrp.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Health Science Careers program</a> partners with high schools across the state to enable high school juniors and seniors to earn up to 31 college credits in preparation for a career in a health field. These partnerships include post secondary Licensed Practical Nursing programs. </p>

          <h2>Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy</h2>
                <p>The <a href="http://pharmacy.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy</a> offers a preeminent, entry-level six-year professional curriculum leading to the doctor of pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree. The program prepares graduates for practicing the profession of pharmacy in community, medical, and health care facilities; in corporate and retail settings; and in industrial and academic research laboratories. The program also prepares students for future graduate or professional study.</p>
            <h2>Nursing</h2>
                <p>Both the <a href="http://nursing.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/" target="_blank">College of Nursing</a> and <a href="http://sn.rutgers.edu/academics/index.htm" target="_blank">School of Nursing</a> offer baccalaureate degrees. Options for study include regular full-time, accelerated full-time, and part-time tracks. Other programs include an accelerated 14-month B.S.N. for students who already have an undergraduate bachelor&rsquo;s degree as well as R.N. to B.S.N. tracks.</p>
