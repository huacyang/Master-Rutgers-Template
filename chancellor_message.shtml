                <p>Welcome to Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS). Over the last 20 months, I have been privileged to lead the complex integration process that has joined most of the units of the former University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey with Rutgers. As chair of the RBHS chancellor search committee, I can share with you my excitement regarding the appointment of Brian L. Strom as the inaugural chancellor of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, effective December 2, 2013. As we await the arrival of the new chancellor, Rutgers president Robert L. Barchi has asked me to continue to work with RBHS in the capacity of interim chancellor. I am honored to assume this temporary role to ensure a smooth transition until the new chancellor is in place.</p>
                <p>There is so much to look forward to as we enter this new era for health care and health education in New Jersey. As an integrated institution, we will strengthen our collaborations and improve our competitiveness for federal research dollars, solidifying Rutgersâ€™ position among the country's top public research universities. Our new structure will expand educational opportunities to make programs more accessible to students through expansion and development of new interprofessional training and interdisciplinary degree programs.</p>
                <p>In health care services, we will work to create a new, more powerful, integrated patient-centered  delivery system that will benefit citizens throughout New Jersey. We will do this by building institutional partnerships, breaking down departmental barriers, and enhancing cooperation across disciplines so that we can optimize health care delivery and work to reduce health care costs.</p>
                <p>We also will work to strengthen and expand public-private partnerships by creating an integrated research enterprise that will encourage collaborations among academia, industry, foundations, and government agencies. Research scientists and clinicians will be incentivized to drive innovation and development of new medical treatments from bench to bedside quickly and efficiently. We are building sustainable economic models so that the new partnerships will spur economic growth and create new jobs in the state.</p>
                <p>Building on our strengths, Rutgers will earn its rightful place among the nation's top-tier academic medical centers and research universities.</p>
                <p>Christopher J. Molloy</p>
